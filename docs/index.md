python tools for adding clock data to a timescale db. 

## Overview

`opensampl` is a package released by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) that provides tools for adding clock 
data to a postgres database. 

The package includes a CLI tool that allows users to load data from ADVA probes into a 
PostgreSQL database (preferably a [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) flavor of PostgreSQL, but it can work with 
any PostgreSQL-based databases) 

The tool supports loading both metadata and time series data from files, with options to
skip loading one or the other. It also provides features for archiving processed files and setting the maximum number 
of worker threads for parallel processing, and helper functions for easily adding additional clocks to the database.

There is also an optional `server` extra which can be used to set your environment up more easily.
